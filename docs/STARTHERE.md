**This is a work-in-progress project.  Expect issues to be present and changes to be made to this repository.**

**Furthermore, this project involves work with lithium batteries and minor soldering.  Please do not attempt building this project unless you are confident with the risks involved.**
## Requirements

**[Bluepad32]**: Library for ESP32 microcontrollers to connect to Bluetooth HID devices.  See link for installation instructions.

**[Pico SDK]** (Optional): Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) C++ libraries and packages to build binary files.  Refer to [this video] for installation to VSCode.

**[Pimoroni SDK]** (Optional): Servo2040-specific libraries and packages

## Assembly Instructions
Refer to the following docs in order:

1. Bill of Materials (BOM)
   * Important: Check the dimensions of the servo before moving to the later steps, especially if purchasing from a vendor different from the BOM. 

2. Servo Calibration Instructions
3. Build Instructions
4. Electronics Layout + Example Wiring
5. Programming Instructions
